The easiest way to run this script is by using the `daemon` daemonizer
(installed by default in FreeBSD).  ProtoIRC for some reason does not
like to work with other methods of daemonization (causes extreme
memory leaks and lockups).  Invoke as follows:

$ daemon -p bot.pid /usr/local/bin/php nagios.php
